<!--
This is the XML DTD for the JAIN SLEE 1.1 library component jar file deployment
descriptor.  All JAIN SLEE 1.1 library component jar file deployment descriptors
must include a DOCTYPE of the following form:

  <!DOCTYPE library-jar PUBLIC
        "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD JAIN SLEE Library 1.1//EN"
        "http://java.sun.com/dtd/slee-library-jar_1_1.dtd">
-->


<!--
The library-jar element is the root element of the library jar deployment
descriptor.  It contains an optional description about the library jar file,
one or more library definitions, and an optional specification of additional
security permissions that should be granted to any classes contained in the
library component jar itself.
-->
<!ELEMENT library-jar (description?, library+, security-permissions?)>

<!--
The description element may contain any descriptive text about the parent
element.

Used in: library-jar, library, library-ref, jar, security-permissions
-->
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The library element defines a library.  It contains an optional description
about the library, the name, vendor, and version of the library being defined,
zero or more references to any other library components that this library
depends on, and information about zero or more jar files that contain
prepackaged classes and resources to be included with the library.

The classes and resources for a library are the sum total of the classes and
resources contained in:
- the library component jar itself (if any)
- the library jars specified by the jar elements (if any)

All these classes are loaded by the same classloader.

Used in: library-jar
-->
<!ELEMENT library (description?, library-name, library-vendor,
          library-version, library-ref*, jar*)>

<!--
The library-name element contains the name of a library component.

Used in: library, library-ref

Example:
    <library-name>JCC</library-name>
-->
<!ELEMENT library-name (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The library-vendor element contains the vendor of a library component.

Used in: library, library-ref

Example:
    <library-vendor>javax.csapi.cc.jcc</library-vendor>
-->
<!ELEMENT library-vendor (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The library-version element contains the version of a library component.  The
version number typically should have the general form
"major-version.minor-version".

Used in: library, library-ref

Example:
    <library-version>1.1</library-version>
-->
<!ELEMENT library-version (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The library-ref element declares a reference to another library component that
this library component depends on.  It contains an optional description and the
name, vendor, and version of the library component.

Used in: library
-->
<!ELEMENT library-ref (description?, library-name, library-vendor,
          library-version)>

<!--
The jar element declares a library jar.  It contains an optional description,
the name of the jar file within in the library component jar, and an optional
specification of additional security permissions that should be granted to
classes contained in the library jar.

Used in: library
-->
<!ELEMENT jar (description?, jar-name, security-permissions?)>

<!--
The jar-name element contains the name of a jar file packaged within the
library component jar.  The jar file will be included in the classloader for
the library component.  The name must be relative URL, relative to the base of
the library component jar file.

Used in: jar

Example:
    <jar-name>jcc-1.1.jar</jar-name>
-->
<!ELEMENT jar-name (#PCDATA)>

<!-- 
The security-permissions element allows additional permissions to be granted
to classes included in the jars in the library, over and above the default
permissions granted by the SLEE.  It contains an optional description and a
mandatory security permission specification.

Used in: library-jar, jar
-->
<!ELEMENT security-permissions (description?, security-permission-spec)>

<!--
The security-permission-spec element specifies security permissions based on
the security policy file syntax. Refer to the following URL for definition of
Sun's security policy file syntax:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/PolicyFiles.html#FileSyntax

Note: The codeBase argument of any grant entries in the security permission
specification is ignored.  The SLEE assumes the code bases to be library jars
included in the library.

The security permissions specified here are granted to the classes contained in
the jars included in the library being specified only.  They are not granted to
classes from any other dependent library component.

Used in: security-permissions

Example:
<security-permission-spec>
    grant {
        permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThreadGroup";
    };
</security-permission-spec>
-->
<!ELEMENT security-permission-spec (#PCDATA)>


<!-- 
The ID mechanism is to allow tools that produce additional deployment
information (ie. information beyond that contained by the standard SLEE
deployment descriptors) to store the non-standard information in a separate
file, and easily refer from those tools-specific files to the information in
the standard deployment descriptor.  The SLEE architecture does not allow the
tools to add the non-standard information into the SLEE-defined deployment
descriptors.
