/**
 * The virtual provisioned pipe interface provides information on a VPrP whose status can be in one of the following states:																																	-  Active:  a previously established VPrP, which indicates that a previous request to create the VPrP was granted by the provider. Packet that belong to this VPrP and meet the validity time requirements, are admitted to the enterprise VPrN																																	-  Pending:  a request to create a new VPrP is still pending response from the provider, indicating that the provider is still processing the request to create a new VPrP. Packet that belong to this VPrP are not admitted to the enterprise VPrN																																	-  Disallowed:  a request to create a new VPrP was denied. A description parameter may include the reason for the denial. This is an disallowed VPrP and packet that belong to this VPrP are not admitted to the enterprise VPrN.																																				A VPrP is composed of the following elements, each of which provides the following Provisioned QoS measures:	Element type                                     Element                                             QoS measure									 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			Endpoint                                     A SAP or a site						Pipe QoS information based 																									on VPrP endpoints: load parameters,																							 policing action.
