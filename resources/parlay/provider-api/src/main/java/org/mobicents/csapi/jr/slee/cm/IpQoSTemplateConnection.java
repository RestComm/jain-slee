/**
 * This interface provides access to a specific QoS template, such as Gold, offered by the provider. This interface provides get methods to discover the QoS service details, and set methods to set the requested values for a new VPrP. The template specifies the QoS parameters and their default values. Each service template parameter is tagged by the service provider to indicate one of the following:																							- Provider specified: the value cannot be modified for this template.														- Enterprise operator specified: operator may change the default value set by the provider. The default value can be blank to indicate that there is no default value for this parameter, and the user can change it according to advice typically given by the description parameters.																						- Unspecified: the parameter is not used for this template, and the Enterprise operator cannot change it.																																					For example, maximum delay for a Gold template may be provider specified, while maximum bandwidth may be Enterprise operator specified, meaning that its values can be changed by the setProvisionedQoSInfo, or by setPipeQoSInfo methods. Guidance how to change the default values may be provided by the template description parameter.																															The tag of a parameter cannot be changed by any set method of this interface, i.e., if a parameter is tagged unspecified, or provider specified, Enterprise operator cannot override the value of this tag to say operator specified.																																			This template is a temporary interface created as a copy of the original template that stores all the template parameters. The temporary interface is created with the getTemplate method of IpQoSMenu interface. The values passed to this template interface by the set methods replace (if permitted by the tags) the default values stored in this template interface, i.e., a get following a set method to this template interface will fetch the new values set by the Enterprise operator. Once a new VPrP is created by the create method in IpVPrN, the temporary interface might not be accessible anymore.

The Provisioned QoS Information has the following information:     														The Delay descriptor lists the delay default values, i.e., default values for mean delay, maximum delay, minimum delay, and delay priority. A provider may choose to tag any number of delay parameters as provider specified, Enterprise operator specified, or unspecified. For example, a Gold template may have a default value just for the mean delay, leaving the other parameters either unspecified, or some set to enterprise operator specified.       						The loss descriptor lists the packet loss default values, i.e., mean loss, maximum loss, minimum loss, and loss priority. A provider may choose to tag any number of loss parameters as provider specified, Enterprise operator specified, or unspecified. For example, a Gold template may have a default value just for the mean loss only, leaving the other parameters either unspecified, or some be Enterprise operator specified.      										The jitter descriptor lists the jitter default values (the delay measured between arriving packets), that is, mean jitter, maximum jitter, minimum jitter, and jitter priority. A provider may choose to tag any number of jitter parameters as provider specified Enterprise operator specified, or unspecified. For example, a Gold template may have a default value just for the mean jitter only, leaving the other parameters either unspecified, or some may be Enterprise operator specified.      																														The excess load action parameter specifies the policing treatment for traffic that exceeds the load parameters set for the virtual provisioned pipe. This policing function can take the following actions when the provider network detects that the traffic trying to enter the VPrP exceeds the load parameters specified in the pipe QoS loads parameters:      		 Drop: 	drop packets (i.e., do not ever transmit them) that exceed the load traffic parameters that were set for the VPrP       																																- Transmit:	transmit packets even though transmitting them will create a load in excess of the load traffic parameters that were set for the VPrP      																							-  Reshape: 	reshape the entering traffic by trying to keep the packet (and not drop them yet) waiting for the entering traffic load to come down below the load conditions set for the VPrP, and if it does, transmit the packets then.     	-  Remark :	remark the packet for a lower QoS service, then transmit them (i.e., transfer the packet through some other less demanding VPrP). This may result in increased packet loss (i.e., the excess packets may have now higher probability of being dropped before reaching their SAP or Site destination), or increased packet delay and / or packet jitter.
