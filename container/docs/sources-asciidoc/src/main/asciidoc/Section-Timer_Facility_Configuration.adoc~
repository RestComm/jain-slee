= Timer Facility Configuration

The JAIN SLEE Timer Facility is the module responsible for managing SLEE timers, and the number of threads it uses is configurable.

The Timer Facility configuration can be changed through an XML file and a JMX MBean.

== Timer Facility Persistent Configuration

Configuration is done through an XML descriptor for each {this-platform} Cluster.
The XML file is named [path]_jboss-beans.xml_ and is located at [path]_{JBOSS_HOME}/server/{profile_name}/deploy/restcomm-slee/META-INF_

The configuration is exposed a JBoss Microcontainer Bean:

== Timer Facility JMX Configuration

Through JMX the Timer Facility module configuration can be changed with the container running.
Note that such configuration changes are not persisted.

The JMX MBean which can be used to change the Timer Facility configuration is named [app]`org.mobicents.slee:name=TimerFacilityConfiguration`, and provides getters and setters to change each property defined in the persistent configuration.
The JMX Console can be used to use this MBean, see <<_management_jmx_console>>.
