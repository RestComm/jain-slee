			<title>Binary Release</title>
			<para>You can download the Binary zip files from <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mobicents/files/Mobicents JAIN SLEE Server"/>.</para>
			<procedure>
				<para>In this form of installation, simply unzip the downloaded zip file to the directory of your choice on any operating system that supports the zip format.</para>
  				<step>
				    <title>Unzip the release file</title>
				    <para>Unzip the file to extract the archive contents into the location of your choice. You can do this using the JDK jar tool (or any other ZIP extraction tool). In the example below we are assuming you downloaded the zip file was named mobicents-jainslee-&THIS.VERSION;.zip to the /mobicents directory.</para>
				    <programlisting>
				    [usr]$ cd /mobicents
				    [usr]$ jar -xvf mobicents-jainslee-&THIS.VERSION;.zip

			    	<title>Setting up JBOSS_HOME Environment Variable</title>
				    <para> You should now have a directory called mobicents-jainslee-&THIS.VERSION;. Next you need to set your JBOSS_HOME environment variables. This is discussed in <xref linkend="jboss_home_setup"/>.</para>

				    <para>Use Git to checkout the specific release source, the Git repository URL is https://code.google.com/p/jain-slee/ , then switch to the specific release version, lets consider &THIS.VERSION;.</para>

			<title>Master Source Building</title>
			<para>Similar process as for <xref linkend="release_source_building"/>, the only change is the Git reference should be the <literal>master</literal>. The <literal>git checkout tags/&THIS.VERSION;</literal> command should not be performed. If already performed, the following should be used in order to switch back to the master:</para>
