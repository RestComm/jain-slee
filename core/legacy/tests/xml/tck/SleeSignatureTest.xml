   Signature test for the JAIN SLEE 1.0 API

   This test verifies the existence of all expected public and protected
   classes.  In those public and protected classes it verifies the
   existence, correct modifiers, arguments and throws clause of public
   and protected constructors.  It verifies the existence, correct
   modifiers, arguments, return type, and throws clause of public and
   protected methods.  It verifies the existence, correct modifiers of
   public and protected nested classes and interfaces. It also verifies
   the existence and correct modifiers of public and protected fields.
   
   This test is version specific.  The current version is 1.0. 

   See the 'Test-Specific Information' chapter in SLEE TCK User's Guide for more information
   on configuration for this test.

 <!-- CONFIGURATION OPTION STARTS
   The default API signature (slee-1_0.sig) was created using the JMX 1.0 API, but a variant was created 
   using JMX 1.1 (slee-1_0-with-jmx1_1.sig) which is supported by this test. 
   If your implementation uses JMX 1.1: 
    - In the lib directory under SLEE TCK's base directory, replace jmxri.jar with jmxri1.1.jar
    - In this file, use the supplied variant of the executeClass element which references slee-1_0-with-jmx1_1.sig
